# Stack Visualizer
I made this visualizer so I could visualize Common Intermediate Language programs, but it can be used for pretty much anything stack related

Visualizations are controlled with a scripting language called SVScript([docs](./svscript.md))

## Usage
**Note** If `python3` doesn't work for these commands, try `python` instead
* Download or clone the repo
* Cd into the repo
* Check if you have Python installed by running `python3 --version`
    > If you don't have it, install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads) or via brew with `brew install python3`
* Run `sh setup.sh`
* To get Stack Visualizer running help, run `python3 main.py -h` or `python3 main.py --help`
